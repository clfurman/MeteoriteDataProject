1. Navigate to the <b>starter_files</b> branch.

2.. Download the files located in the <b>starter_files</b> section. You will need to extract them and save them on your computer.

3. Open Visual Studio Code. Open the <code>MeteoriteDataProject-starter-files</code> project by selecting <b>Open Folder</b> from the File menu.

4. Open the <b>Meteorite_Landings.csv</b> file and identify the fields you will need to represent in your <code>Meteor</code> record and <code>GeoLocation</code> record. The starter files store dates as <code>String</code> objects.
   NOTE: each row represents an individual meteor and each column represents the data we know about the meteor.
   This data is <bold>immutable data </bold>. Therefore a record is the correct type of storage.

5. Create your <code>Meteor</code> record.

6. Be sure to add your package at the top of the files and save the file as <b>Meteor.java</b>.
   Since the <code>GeoLocation</code> contains the latitude and longitude values, we don't actually need to store the latitude and longitude values separately.
   You only need to store 8 fields. To add a new Java file to the project, click on the the file icon with the plus symbol.
7. Create the <code>GeoLocation</code> record. It will contain two fields. Save the file as <b>GeoLocation.java</b>
8. Modify the runner class, <b>SIGCSEMeteor2.java</b> to ensure the file path for the <b>Meteorite_Landings.csv</b> is where you saved it on your computer.
    Run the <b>SIGCSEMeteor2.java</b> main method to import the data and add the meteors with a mass less than 5000 to a new list. â€‹
9. Your solution may be similar to those in the <b>Solution_Files</b> branch.
